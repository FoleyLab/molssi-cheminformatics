    "Cheminformatics is often used in the context of molecular discovery. \n",
    "For example, you might want to process a large number of molecules to find molecules that are similar to a target, or that contain a particular functional group. \n",
    "But how can you tell if two molecules are similar?\n",
    "\n",
    "A chemist looking at two molecules might be able to make a judgment based on their chemical knowledge. However, when dealing with a large number of molecules, this problem can become intractable. However, there are wayts to detect molecular similarity on a computer. We will discuss two: graph representations of molecules and molecular fingerprints. \n",
    "Both can be used to measure molecule similarity. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph Representation of Molecules\n",
    "Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties and applications of graphs, which are structures made up of nodes (or vertices) connected by edges (or lines).\n",
    "A molecule can be represented as a graph where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges. This representation allows the use of various graph-based algorithms to analyze molecular structures. \n",
    "The figure below (borrowed from Wikipedia) shows a graph with numbered nodes (circles) connected by edges (lines).\n",
    "\n",
    "![example of a graph with nodes and edges](images/molecular_graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Image from [Wikipedia: Graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a chemist, you probably don't have a hard time imagining a molecule as a graph. The atoms would be \"nodes\" in the graph, while the bonds would be \"edges\".\n",
    "One can also represent bond order by changing the \"weight\" of graph edges.\n",
    "In this view, one way to tell if molecules are the same is to check that their molecular graphs are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Substructure Searches\n",
    "\n",
    "A substructure search is a cheminformatics technique used to identify molecules that contain a specific pattern or structure within a larger molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows the beneze substructure matched in the aspirin molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "![substructure](images/substructure.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "One way this can be done is with graph representaiton and graph theory. \n",
    "When doing substructure search using RDKit, it can check to see if the molecular graph for one molecule contains the molecular graph of a smaller molecule.\n",
    "This is a concept called \"subgraph isomorphism\". You can see more about this topic in this [presentation](https://www.rdkit.org/UGM/2012/Landrum_RDKit_UGM.Fingerprints.Final.pptx.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all very nice information, but you actually don't have to fully understand it in order to do a substructure search.\n",
    "In the cells below, we demonstrate searching molecules for a smaller structure using substructure search. \n",
    "As you can see from the cells, this functionality is very nicely built into RDKit."

    "#### SMARTS Strings\n",
    "A [SMARTS (SMiles ARbitrary Target Specification)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMILES_arbitrary_target_specification) string is a pattern-matching language for specifying substructures in molecules. It is similar to SMILES but has additional features for specifying atom and bond properties. In contrast to SMILES, SMARTS allows for specifying substructures based on patterns of atoms and bonds, rather than just specifying the exact arrangement of atoms and bonds in a molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we want to highlight the methyl group in caffeine, which contains a single carbon atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms. We can use a SMARTS string to define this substructure as `[CH3]`, which represents a carbon atom with three hydrogen atoms bonded to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a SMARTS string is necessary in this case because simply searching for a single carbon atom with the code `carbon = Chem.MolFromSmiles('C')` highlights all carbons in the molecule, not just the methyl group. By using a SMARTS string, we can specify the exact substructure we want to highlight and avoid highlighting unintended parts of the molecule."

    "## Molecular Fingerprints\n",
    "Molecular fingerprints are representations of molecules that are usually bit strings, or vectors of 0's and 1's. Fingerprints are built by considering the molecular structure (often as a graph representation) and applying a certain algorithm to create the vector. The image below shows a representation of a molecular fingerprint. The molecule is separated into different parts with each part setting a bit (changing a 0 to a 1) in the fingerprint.\n",
